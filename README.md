# CS 85 - Module 7 Assignment 7A: Hello Route


### Reflection Questions

1.What is Laravel and why is it useful for developers?

- Laravel is a modern PHP web framework that makes building web applications faster and easier. It provides features like routing, authentication, and database tools, which help developers write clean and maintainable code. Its elegant syntax and built-in tools save time and reduce repetitive coding tasks.

2.What does the /greet/{name} route do?

- The /greet/{name} route takes a name from the URL and displays a personalized greeting. For example, visiting /greet/alex will return “Hello, Alex!”. This demonstrates how Laravel routes can handle dynamic parameters.

3.Why is it important to use Git and GitHub in software projects?

- Git and GitHub allow developers to track changes to their code and collaborate with others easily. They provide version control, backup, and a history of all edits, which makes managing projects safer and more organized. GitHub also makes sharing code and working in teams much easier.
